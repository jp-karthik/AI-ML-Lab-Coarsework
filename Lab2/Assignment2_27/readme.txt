=> For executing the program we need a input file with name "input.txt".
=> The input file should contain an input of 6 lines, where the first three lines- 
   corresponds to the start state and the latter 3 lines corressponds to the final state.
=> Each line represents a stack, where each boxes are represented by a character.
=> There should be a space given after each character input. 
=> The rightmost character(box) present in a line would be considered as the topmost element for the stack.
=> During the execution of the program, giving different inputs will trigger to implement different algorithms-
   and necessary output after the execution of the algorithm would be displayed.
