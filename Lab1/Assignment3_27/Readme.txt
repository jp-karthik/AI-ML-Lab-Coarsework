=> This program generates a random SAT formula which are dependent on the inputs N(number of variables) 
   and K(number of clauses) and writes the formula into a text file named "input.txt". 
   
=> The format in which the randomly generated valid clauses are written in the output file is: 
   * Each line contains a clause of 3 literals where each literal is seperated by a blank space.
   * The number of lines present in the output file is equal to the value of K.
   
=> The same program uses this output file generated as an input file to itself, where the input file	
   contains a randomly generated 3-CNF SAT formula.
   
=> During the execution of the program, giving different inputs will trigger to implement different 
   algorithms and corresponding output will be displayed after the execution of the selected algorithm.
